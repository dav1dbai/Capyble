# With Capyble, you are CAPABLE💪


## Capyble - Your On-Screen Focus Companion
Files you need to prepare for running Capyble: 1. Get your own Credentials.json from Google Calendar API. When you run quickstart.py, it should generate a tokens.json file. If monitor.py dones't work, you can try run quickstart.py first and monitor.py should be able to run afterwards.



## Inspiration

We've all been there: determined to complete a task, only to get sidetracked by the internet's endless distractions. Capyble was born from the need for a friendly nudge to stay on track, reminiscent of a parental reminder to focus on homework. Capyble is your digital companion that not only reminds you of your tasks but helps you stick to them.

## What is Capyble?

Capy is an on-screen buddy that keeps your schedule and to-do list in mind. When it's time to work, Capy engages with you, discussing your agenda and offering personalized suggestions. Using Gemini Vision Pro technology, Capy monitors your activity and gently reminds you to stay focused, especially if you're deviating from your tasks.

## Features

- **Draggable Interface**: Interact with Capy by clicking and dragging it around your screen. Have fun with its responsive nature powered by Flask and React.
- **Chatbox**: Chat with Capy for daily planning assistance. It integrates OpenAI's API for smart interactions and Google Calendar for scheduling.
- **Focus Monitoring**: Capy captures screenshots and monitors your activity to ensure you stay focused, stepping in like a virtual guardian.

## How We Built Capyble

Capyble operates within a wxPython Window, rendering Capy as a sprite, alongside an Electron Desktop App for the UI, with React components. Backend operations are managed through Flask endpoints, with Supabase for data management. Our focus feature utilizes Gemini Vision Pro for intelligent activity evaluation.

## Challenges We Ran Into

The main hurdles were managing multiple app frameworks and addressing complex deployment issues. Additionally, we navigated through the complexities of Git during a fast-paced hackathon, a first for many of us.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of

Our team dove headfirst into a variety of technologies, culminating in significant learning and growth. Front-end novices became adept in React, and we collectively embraced the collaborative coding process.

## What We Learned

Our journey was filled with learning—from mastering new tools to understanding the intricacies of collaborative software development.

## What's Next for Capyble

We plan to enhance our capybara's design and user experience, making it not only functional but irresistibly cute. We're also focusing on backend optimization to improve performance and security.
